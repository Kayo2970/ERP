/**
 * proposals.ts — shared (server + client safe, no window/localStorage) types
 * and visibility rules for the Proposals module.
 *
 * Flow: any member submits a proposal addressed to groups and/or individual
 * members -> it sits at 'Pending Approval' where only the author and the
 * authorised approvers (Centre Head, Advisors, department Heads) can see it ->
 * once approved it is delivered (visible + emailed) to the recipients, who can
 * respond Under Review / Accepted / Declined.
 *
 * The API (src/app/api/proposals) does all filtering server-side and attaches a
 * `viewer` block to each item, so the page never re-implements these rules.
